## The Appointment {#the-appointment}

1.  Check the appointment and make notes on what the student wants to talk about, review course materials or rubrics if you need to.
2.  Email the student if you need more details, or any material that will help you prepare.
3.  Read up on the student in the Student Manager. Check out the Notes and previous Submissions section.

### Videoconferencing setup {#videoconferencing-setup}

For the 1:1 appointments, we suggest using Zoom.us. Instructions to set up a persistent Zoom URL are located further up in this document.

**During the meeting**

A student may bring up a topic that you are not familiar with, and that’s okay! In general, you are not responsible for knowing content outside of your Udacity course material, but it’s up to you if you’d like to try and help the student anyway. You could say that you don’t really have experience with that particular tool so you may not be of much help, but you can look into it and try to work through the material together. You may be able to grasp it quickly since you have more experience, and it could be a good way to learn something new!

Lastly, please ask the student to fill out this [post-appointment survey](http://goo.gl/forms/NKxbl7wEl4) before their appointment ends so that we can capture more ongoing data about how to improve the program.

**After the meeting**

After your meeting concludes (or if the student does not appear within 15 minutes, as outlined in the FAQ section), fill out the [1:1 Appointment Self-Reporting](https://goo.gl/forms/Un6WTAlopI0B5vZD3) form. This will serve as a self-reflection for you, as well as a timecard for us to issue payment each month. We may also use the material to create better training and feedback resources for you.
