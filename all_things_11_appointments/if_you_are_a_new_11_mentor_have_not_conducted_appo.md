### If you are setting up Calendly as a new user… {#if-you-are-a-new-1-1-mentor-have-not-conducted-appointments-via-calendly-before}

Please follow these instructions to set up 1:1 appointments on Calendly, and let **@annie** know if you have any questions.

**IMPORTANT: please do not make any changes to "When can people book this event?" in Calendly as it is shared by all Mentors on your team--use the settings page ONLY to change whether or not you are included in the round robin. Make all schedule changes on your personal calendar only, as outlined below.**

If you see events toggled off that you think should be on, please DM me and I will turn them back on. I have given everyone admin permissions for their team because I want you to be able to mark your availability for projects at will, but I realize that this can also make things confusing since many of Calendly’s features are quite granular. If ever confused, safer to DM me before taking action!

1.  Sign up for your Calendly account via the link in the invitation email you’ll receive.
2.  Go to the calendar connected to your email account and block off all the times you will not be available (ie Google Calendar if you signed up with a Gmail account, etc.). Calendly communicates with your calendar in order to generate available times for appointments. Since Mentors are located all over the world, Calendly will search for available times 24 hours a day, so it is imperative that you keep your Calendar up-to-date.

    **Example:** If you do not want to take appointments between the hours of 8PM and 10AM in your timezone, create an event and label it something like ”Busy” or “Not taking appointments” for yourself. Calendly will know to mark you as Unavailable during those times.

    **Tip:** Most calendar apps have the option to set recurring events. If you are afraid that you will forget to create a new event to account for your unavailability hours, make use of this feature!

    **Tip:** We have set Calendly to allow users to schedule appointments up to 14 days in advance, but if you are going on vacation or otherwise won’t be available for a day or more, you can mark yourself as unavailable as far into the future as needed.

    **Tip:** More information can be found on this Calendly help article: [I’m unavailable when I should be free](http://help.calendly.com/article/114-im-unavailable-when-i-should-be-free)

3.  Message Annie on the Forum Mentors Slack team directly so she can add you to the correct team.
4.  Once you’ve been added to the team, click **Event Types** at the top of your Calendly Dashboard. You should see a Team for each Nanodegree program you’ll be Mentoring for. Click on the Team and once it expands, you should see all the different projects available for that Nanodegree program.
5.  Set which projects you are ready to conduct 1:1 appointments for by following these instructions:

    Click the gear icon and click “Edit”:

**IMPORTANT: Do not, under any circumstances, toggle an event on/off in Calendly as this will affect all students’ ability to book appointments for that project.**
    
    Click “Team Members and Location” to trigger a drop-down:

6.  Check your name if you are ready to begin taking 1:1 appointments for a particular project. If you are not yet comfortable helping students with that project make sure to uncheck the box next to your name so that you will not be included in the round robin.
7.  Under Location, input: `“We’ll be meeting on Zoom. Join here at your appointment time: [url]”` Instructions to set up your persistent Zoom URL can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5bRk1eOyktZUEVKdk9BZFk3WkU/view?usp=sharing)!
8.  Remember to save your changes!
