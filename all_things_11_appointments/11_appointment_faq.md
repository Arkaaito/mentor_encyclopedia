## 1:1 Appointment FAQ {#1-1-appointment-faq}

### 1:1 Mentorship Program Information {#1-1-mentorship-program-information}

**How much do I get paid?**

We currently pay $25/30-minute appointment. Please remember to fill out the [1:1 Appointment Self-Reporting form](https://goo.gl/forms/Un6WTAlopI0B5vZD3) after each appointment as we will use this to quantify your activity.

**When do I get paid?**

Payments are issued on or around the 15th of each month, and payment periods run from the 27th to 27th of each month. If you are also a Forum Mentor or Code Reviewer, you may receive a lump sum in your Paypal.

**What happens if an appointment goes overtime?**

In the 1:1 Appointment Self-Reporting form, we ask for the length of your appointment. We wish to be respectful of your time, which is why we encourage you to wind down after 30 minutes have passed. If the student still has questions, you can encourage them to post in the forums or schedule another meeting for the following week. It can be helpful to use the last 5 minutes or so of an appointment to set goals and action items for the student before their next appointment.

In some cases, if it is determined that there was indeed a need for the appointment to go significantly over, we are happy to pay you the difference. Please reach out to your Nanodegree program’s Coach if you are uncertain as to whether your appointment qualifies for this exception.

**What happens if a student does not show up for their appointment at the correct time?**

There will be students who show up late, or who don’t show up at all.  If a student does not show up within 15 minutes, you can call the student a no-show and log it in the 1:1 Appointment Self-Reporting form. Please follow up with an email to the student; you can write your own, or use this template:

> Hi ,
> 
> We missed you at your 1:1 appointment yesterday. Please schedule another time on the calendar here: https://calendly.com/(your link)
> 
> In the future please try to cancel appointments at least 24 hours in advance if you know that you won't be able to make it.
> 
> Thanks!

**What to do about impromptu meetings?**

There may be times, when actively engaging with a student on the forums, where you feel that more progress can be made via a one-on-one appointment. In this case, feel free to ask them if they would like to meet with you and schedule the appointment organically.

You may also choose to create a personal 30-minute event on Calendly that students can book with little to no lead time. You can do so by going to 'Event Types' and adding a Personal Event Type for a One-on-One appointment.

_All appointments must be logged on the self-reporting form!_

### Calendly {#calendly}

**What is round robin, and how does it work?**

_“Calendly's round-robin feature streamlines scheduling by letting an invitee instantly schedule with any available team member. This increases the chances of your invitee finding a convenient time.”_

For example, say that Annie, Jared, and Kelly all want to set up availability for 1:1 appointments, and these are the times they say they are available on their personal calendars:

*   **Annie:** 10:00-11:00AM, 1:00-2:00PM, 5:00-8:00PM
*   **Jared:** 10:00-11:00AM, 1:00-3:00PM
*   **Kelly:** 10:00-11:00AM

The times that students would see as available appointment slots would be 10:00-11:00AM, 1:00-3:00PM, and 5:00-8:00PM. Up to 3 students could schedule appointments from 10:00-11:00AM, since Annie, Jared, and Kelly all say they can take appointments during that block of time, but each person would only be assigned a maximum of one appointment.

Likewise, two appointments are available from 1:00-2:00PM, but only Jared will get scheduled for appointments from 2:00-3:00PM.

Regardless of how many projects you are available to Mentor for, Calendly will only schedule you one appointment per time slot. Thus, if Jared is Mentoring for both Project 1 and Project 2 at 1:00-3:00PM, that availability will disappear from the Project 2 calendar if someone signs up for it for Project 1.
