## Best Practices {#best-practices}

The way you approach your one-on-one appointments can have a big impact on your interactions with students. The following guidelines will help you communicate effectively and establish healthy Mentor-mentee dynamics.

*   **Be friendly and positive**
    *   Greet students by saying something pleasant. Example: “Hi Alex! What can I help you with?”
    *   Look for the good in what students have done so far. People are often motivated by positive reinforcement and disengage when they feel discouraged.
    *   Show enthusiasm when you’re excited!
*   **Be encouraging**
    *   You know that it&#039;s normal to feel challenged by Nanodegree content. Acknowledge that learning will be difficult for everyone at times but that the challenges are surmountable.
    *   Remind the student that everyone makes mistakes, professionals included.
    *   Applaud their efforts!
    *   Feel free to share about your experience in the Nanodegree as a point of encouragement. You are proof that achieving your goals is possible with perseverance!
*   **Be authentic and professional**
    *   Be professional by respecting boundaries (of the student and of yourself) while still being friendly.
    *   Treat students respect, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, etc.
    *   It is perfectly fine to include smiley faces :) but not XOXO, &lt;3, or ;-). Stay away from emoticons that might be perceived in a different sense by a student.
    *   Only share things you’re 100% comfortable sharing.
    *   Be yourself!
