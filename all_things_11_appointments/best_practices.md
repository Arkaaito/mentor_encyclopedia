## Best Practices {#best-practices}

The way you approach your one-on-one appointments can have a big impact on your interactions with students. The following guidelines will help you communicate effectively and establish healthy Mentor-mentee dynamics.

*   **Be friendly and positive**
    *   Greet students by saying something pleasant. Example: “Hi Alex! What can I help you with?”
    *   Look for the good in what students have done so far. People are often motivated by positive reinforcement and disengage when they feel discouraged.
    *   Show enthusiasm when you’re excited!
*   **Be encouraging**
    *   You know that it&#039;s normal to feel challenged by Nanodegree content. Acknowledge that learning will be difficult for everyone at times but that the challenges are surmountable.
    *   Remind the student that everyone makes mistakes, professionals included.
    *   Applaud their efforts!
    *   Feel free to share about your experience in the Nanodegree as a point of encouragement. You are proof that achieving your goals is possible with perseverance!
*   **Be authentic and professional**
    *   Be professional by respecting boundaries (of the student and of yourself) while still being friendly.
    *   Treat students respect, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, etc.
    *   It is perfectly fine to include smiley faces :) but not XOXO, &lt;3, or ;-). Stay away from emoticons that might be perceived in a different sense by a student.
    *   Only share things you’re 100% comfortable sharing.
    *   Be yourself!

###Setting Expectations/Preventing Appointment Overtime

For the benefit of both you and students, we ask that you keep one-on-one appointments to 30 minutes or less whenever possible. It is our policy to allocate one (1) 30-minute appointment to each student per week, so we want to set that expectation. Here are some strategies to help set proper expectations for how the time in an appointment will be used:

* Let the student know that you are setting a timer at the beginning of the appointment. You can say something like this:

> "We have 30 minutes, so I'm setting a timer for 25 minutes, during which we'll focus on your most pressing question. When it goes off, we'll wrap up and make a plan for any further support you may need."

* When the timer goes off, obey it! Let the student know that 25 minutes have passed, and reconfirm with the student that their questions were addressed. You can say something like this:

> "It looks like our appointment time is almost up and I think you are on the right track; let's summarize what we talked about today to make sure that you can continue."

* If the student's questions were not all addressed, remind them that they can always post in the Discussion forums.
