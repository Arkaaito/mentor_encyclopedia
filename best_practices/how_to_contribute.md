# Contributing to the Encyclopedia

We want all Mentors to feel ownership over the Forum Mentors Encyclopedia! If you have knowledge you want to share with your fellow Mentors about how best to help students out in the forums or via 1:1 appointments, feel free to make a pull request to the [Mentor Encyclopedia repository](https://github.com/udacity/mentor_encyclopedia) on Github.

A member of the Udacity team will get back to you as soon as possible (feel free to ping someone on Slack if it's been a few days) and either approve the pull request, or provide helpful tips for improvement.

Thanks for all your help!
