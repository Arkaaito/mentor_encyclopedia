# Best Practices - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program
**NOTE: These guidelines are for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program only and have been added here for posterity. If you are a Mentor for other programs, please follow their guidelines, if any are in place. Your Nanodegree program's Coach can also help clarify questions pertinent to your specific program.**

If a forum post is revived by a new student post (for instance, if the thread was last responded to several weeks ago), and the discussion is a continuation of the thread, it should be responded to as normal.

If a forum post is revived by a new student post, and the discussion is not a continuation of the thread (say, a student piggy backs the discussion by questioning/commenting on something moderately tangential to the current content), the student's post (and any following replies related to that post) should be selected using the *Admin -> Select Posts* tool and moved to a new topic in the same/similar forum. Give it a title that best represents the new discussion. Do not move/select posts that still relate to the original thread's discussion. Then, _lock the original thread_.

If a student responds to a forum thread that has been active and the student's discussion is unrelated to the thread's content, follow the same procedure as above by moving that student's and its replies to a new thread. Do not lock/close the original thread.

If a student creates a new thread that you've identified has been answered before in recent memory, feel free to provide a reference to the relevant answers as opposed to constructing new ones.

If a student creates a thread that is in the incorrect forum (for instance, a student talks about feature selection in unsupervised learning, but has posted in principal component analysis), use the *Pencil* next to the thread title and you can edit where the thread is located. Then respond to the student if you are able.

Lastly, if a student creates a thread that is not immediately related to the content or projects (for instance, about graduation, about a specific review they received, about payments, etc.), respond to the student that a Udacity Coach will address their concerns privately and lock/close the thread. Then, email machine-support@udacity.com (at least for MLND-centric discussion), and let us (me) know about the forum post and the student's concern.
