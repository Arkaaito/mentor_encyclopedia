# Tools
As a Forum Mentor, you have access to several tools that will help you answer questions efficiently and stay in close communication with your fellow Mentors and Udacity Coaches.

## Discourse Reader
[Discourse Reader](http://discourse-reader.appspot.com/) is a tool built by our very own Philip (@philip on Slack) that helps Mentors keep track of who is working on what post.

With Discourse Reader, Mentors can:
* Filter unanswered posts by project
* See how recently a post was created
* Claim a post (let others know you are working on an answer) for up to 6 hours
* Resolve answered posts

Check out the [FAQ](http://discourse-reader.appspot.com/static/faq.html) for more information on how to get the most out of Discourse Reader.

## Slack
The Udacity Mentors Slack team is the most integral part of the Mentor community. Here, you'll be able to communicate directly with both other Mentors and members of the Udacity team. Upon joining Slack for the first time, be sure to check out the different Channels you can join by clicking "CHANNELS" in the sidebar.

Mentors may use channels to talk to others working in the same Nanodegree program, coordinate meet-ups, discuss the program, and have fun!

Udacity staff can also be reached via Direct Messages. A list of Coaches is provided in the Forum Mentors FAQ, as well as other members of the team who can help you with any issues.
