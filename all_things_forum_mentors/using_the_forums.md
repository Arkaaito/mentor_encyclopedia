###Teaching Debugging Principles
It’s important that students learn to debug on their own without all of the help of a Udacity coach. For this reason, we should aim not to fix code but to push students in the right direction to do it themselves. Coaches should guide students by suggesting print statements (and other debugging techniques) or by asking leading questions.

###Identify the Bug, Explain the Reason
Identifying bugs is not always enough for students to truly understand why their code is not performing as expected. Breaking the code down as much as possible and teaching students how to understand the error stack trace can help students get to the core of their misunderstandings, and can help them avoid the same mistakes in the future!

###Provide Examples
Giving students examples help them make connections between conceptual level ideas and actual code they can write. 

**Examples:**
* Use Spoiler and Details Tags
* Use the spoiler tag ( ```[spoiler] blah blah [/spoiler]``` ) to hide answers to questions you want the student to answer. This helps cut out a future post in the case the student can’t figure out the answer, while also challenging them to think independently. If you’re hiding code, you can use the details tag. This works for both code blocks and code spans. 
([details=some name] 
``` 
code 
``` 
[/details])
