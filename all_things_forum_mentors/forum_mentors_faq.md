## Forum Mentors FAQ

### Forum Mentorship Program Information

_*Note:* Program terms may change in the future as we continue to scale the program. We will always make every effort to give our Mentors advance notice if changes are in the pipeline._

**How do I get paid?**

Forum Mentors are currently paid per postâ€”the exact amount depends on the complexity level of the Nanodegree program. Payments are issued on or around the 15th of each month, and payment periods run from the 27th to 27th of each month. If you are also a 1:1 Mentor or Code Reviewer, you may receive a lump sum in your Paypal.

**What qualifies as a paid post?**

Currently, all posts in categories and subcategories of your designated Nanodegree program and General count towards payment.

**What are bonus posts?**

Bonus posts are peer-nominated posts that are worth approximately 150% of a normal post. You can nominate yourself or your peers via the [Bonus Post Nomination Form](https://goo.gl/forms/buwqXhoPOBx0ktkb2).

**Do I get paid for helping students on Slack?**

Unfortunately, at this time we cannot pay Mentors for content help provided to students on Slack, or other community channels outside of Udacity Discussions. There are two main reasons for this: we cannot pay contractors by the hour, and it is currently impossible for us to quantify activity on Slack.

If a student does ask you for help, you can either ask them to post the question in the forums and answer there, or set up an appointment with you if you are a 1:1 Mentor.

**What should I do when tax season comes around?**

Income earned through contractor services is taxable and must be reported at the end of each tax year. Paypal will provide an 1099 for customers who have received more than $20,000 USD AND 200 or more payments ([article here](https://www.paypal.com/selfhelp/article/FAQ729)) in a given tax year.

Unfortunately, Udacity cannot provide more in-depth tax advice as every individual's financial situation is different. You will need to manage taxes based on the requirements of the country you reside in. US citizens may want to consult the IRS' section on [Interest, Dividends, and Other Types of Income](https://www.irs.gov/help-resources/tools-faqs/faqs-for-individuals/frequently-asked-tax-questions-answers/interest-dividends-other-types-of-income) when getting started.
