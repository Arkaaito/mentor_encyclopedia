## Forum Mentors FAQ

### Forum Mentorship Program Information

_*Note:* Program terms may change in the future as we continue to scale the program. We will always make every effort to give our Mentors advance notice if changes are in the pipeline._

**How do I get paid?**

Forum Mentors are currently paid per postâ€”the exact amount depends on the complexity level of the Nanodegree program. Payments are issued on or around the 15th of each month, and payment periods run from the 27th to 27th of each month. If you are also a 1:1 Mentor or Code Reviewer, you may receive a lump sum in your Paypal.

**What qualifies as a paid post?**

Currently, all posts in categories and subcategories of your designated Nanodegree program and General count towards payment.

**What are bonus posts?**

Bonus posts are peer-nominated posts that are worth approximately 150% of a normal post. You can nominate yourself or your peers via the [Bonus Post Nomination Form](https://goo.gl/forms/buwqXhoPOBx0ktkb2).

**Do I get paid for helping students on Slack?**

Unfortunately, at this time we cannot pay Mentors for content help provided to students on Slack, or other community channels outside of Udacity Discussions. There are two main reasons for this: we cannot pay contractors by the hour, and it is currently impossible for us to quantify activity on Slack.

If a student does ask you for help, you can either ask them to post the question in the forums and answer there, or set up an appointment with you if you are a 1:1 Mentor.

**Who on the Udacity team should I contact if I have a question?**
