## Forum Mentors FAQ

### Forum Mentorship Program Information

_*Note:* Program terms may change in the future as we continue to scale the program. We will always make every effort to give our Mentors advance notice if changes are in the pipeline._

**How do I get paid?**

Forum Mentors are currently paid per postâ€”the exact amount depends on the complexity level of the Nanodegree program. Payments are issued on or around the 15th of each month. If you are also a 1:1 Mentor or Code Reviewer, you may receive a lump sum in your Paypal.

**What qualifies as a paid post?**

Currently, all posts in categories and subcategories of your designated Nanodegree program and General count towards payment.

**What are bonus posts?**

Bonus posts are peer-nominated posts that are worth approximately 150% of a normal post. You can nominate yourself or your peers via the [Bonus Post Nomination Form](https://goo.gl/forms/buwqXhoPOBx0ktkb2).
