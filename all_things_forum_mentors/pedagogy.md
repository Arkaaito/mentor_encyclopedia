# Pedagogy

When teaching students, we believe students benefit the most when they are taught how to _learn_. This means that rather than aim to solve a students immediate problem, aim to help them solve their own problems. This approach helps develop deeper learning and mastery of the subject material. The approach forces students to create new mental connections between the many different components of the subject they're studying.

We strive to give students what they need in their education, not what they want. Some of the more difficult challenges that you will face will be when you come across students who:

- Do not know how to express what they need help with online
- Need help researching topics
- Want the direct answer
- Don’t know how to start their project
- Want to be “hand-held”

Therefore, in addition to teaching concepts and job specific skills, we strive to teach students two additional _learning_ skills:

1. _Learn_ how to precisely communicate a question or problem in a written format
2. _Learn_ how to research online and find out answers themselves

## Conceptual Teaching
Student questions come in mainly three buckets:

### Technical support questions

Technical support questions are questions that involve installing and using software on the student’s computer. You are not expected to provide detailed technical support for students. You are encouraged to guide them to where they can find answers to the technical support questions they have.

### Conceptual questions

Conceptual questions involve the student’s ability to understand the core ideas that’s being taught in the courses. Students will come in and ask questions in trying to understand that relate to “how” do things work the way they work.

Often times, to understand the “how”, it’s good to give students a clear picture of “why” things are designed the way they are designed.

Therefore we encourage you to not only explain the “how”, but try to give more context and explain to students of why things work the way they work.

For other questions not relating to the “how”, you can try to explain concepts in a more intuitive manner and use analogies and simple to understand examples. 

Explaining in “why’s” and giving intuitive analogies and examples will help students create the mental connections and associations that helps integrate their knowledge of the concept into a holistic and intuitive manner for them.

### Project and Quiz questions

These questions relate to specific implementations of a concept the student has learned. You should help guide students to the right answer and explain what necessary steps to take in order to implement the task that you want the student to do. You should not share any direct workflows or code that a student can copy and paste to directly solve their quiz or project. You are encouraged to provide code examples to illustrate the concept. It's very important to explain the process in plain English and avoid doing the work for the student. 

We strive to act as guides and help students solve the problem, not directly solve it for them.

**Note**: After working with the student for many posts and the student just needs a little bit more push to get to the right answer, feel free to use the spoiler tag in Discourse to hide the answer and encourage the student to push a little bit before the student should peek at the answer.

You should start off with understanding what the student is trying to do and understand where the student is in his/her thinking process:

1. Problem understanding
 - Does the student understand what is being asked?
2. Conceptual understanding
 - Does the student understand the required concepts that is needed to perform the task?
3. Process understanding
 - Does the student understand how to apply the concepts to the task?

The best way to understand where the student is in this process is to ask clarifying questions and questions to challenge the student’s assumptions. This will help force students to reevaluate their process and give you clues to what prior knowledge they have about the problem.

Once you know where the student lacks in understanding, try to explain to students at their level and:

* Use analogies
* Use intuitive examples
* Answer why things are done the way they are and help illustrate process understanding by explicitly calling out connections between different concepts and tasks that the student has done
* Highlight situations and explain when to use certain concepts and skills.


Above all, guide the student to the answer and help them along their educational journey. 

There will be times where a student needs more clues and help. If the student cannot follow along your thinking process after three exchanges, feel free to give more direct clues and use the spoiler tag in the forums if you plan to give the student the direct answer.

The spoiler tag will blur out your answer and will only reveal itself if the student clicks on the text.

## Written Communication
For some students, this will be the first time where they will have to communicate their issues in a technical fashion. You are encouraged to help students communicate their issues and give them resources on how to post a question in the forum.

Make sure to ask students to:

1. Fully explain their situation and what problem they’re trying to solve
2. Outline the steps where the student took
3. Report what errors or issues the students face

At the time of enrollment, we send students this document that outlines how to post a good question in the forums.

[Student Forum Guidance](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vgErB9RadTRXeV2Ih20ydJ32O-lYfNKf7qIFxunJdcQ)

Please look over this document and encourage students to follow this guideline when posting questions.

## Researching Online
Learning how to research independently is a crucial skill in learning online and some students may not have had the experience in trying to find out the answer through online research. If you notice a student having trouble looking up a function or need more help in understanding the material, feel free to guide the student to any online documentation, other forums, and articles that may have addressed the student’s questions.

You should definitely try to paraphrase what other resources are talking about and encourage students to go to these resources to dive deeper into a subject or lookup technical definitions.
